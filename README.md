# Mini Slots

**Mini Slots** is a small Unity project built to explore the core mechanics of a classic slot machine. The goal was to get hands-on experience with common slot gameplay systems, such as reel spinning, win detection, and payouts, in preparation for roles in the slot gaming industry.

This game is playable in-browser on [itch.io](https://your-itch-link-here) and is intended as a showcase project.

## Features

- Reel spinning with animated sprite swaps
- Win detection based on symbol matches
- Simple payout system driven by symbol values
- Credits and betting system
- Modular and object-oriented design using

## Payout Table

Each symbol has a specific payout value when three of the same appear on a payline. A partial win occurs when two symbols match, awarding half the bet amount.

| Symbol | 3-Match Payout (x Bet Amount) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Cherry | 10                            |
| Bell   | 20                            |
| Seven  | 50                            |
| Bar    | 100                           |

- 3 matching symbols: Full payout based on the symbol
- 2 matching symbols: Half the bet amount, regardless of symbol
- No matches: No payout

## In Development / Future Work

- Add reel scrolling animation to better simulate physical slot machines
- Add visual and sound feedback for wins and payouts

## Why I Built This

This project was created to explore slot mechanics and to demonstrate relevant skills for interviews at slot gaming companies. It also served as a way to reinforce object-oriented principles and design pattern usage in a small, focused codebase.

## How to Play

1. Click the slot arm to spin the reels.
2. Match symbols across the reels to win.
3. Track your credits, bet amount, and payouts on the HUD.
